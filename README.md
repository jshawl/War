As a user of the game, I should be able to see the cards, so that I can visualize what is going on.
As someone who might like to have at least a modicum of control over a game of War, there should be a button to progress turnwise through the game, so that it isn't all over in the blink of an electrode.
As someone who has friends, I should be able to play this game with more thon one friend so we all have something to do on saturday night.
