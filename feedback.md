# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job on your user stories! In the future, it would be nice to see more evidence of your planning process - like
a Trello board with current, backlog, and iceboxed user stories.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. I think it's really cool you tackled this project script-first. i.e. focusing on the functionality before the
visual appearance. It would be nice to see you implement more visual things here - I know we discussed a few ideas but let me know if you'd
like to work through them together.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. AWESOME job on the code!! My only recommendation if you were to revisit this project would be to consider
namespacing your code behind a single global variable object. i.e. you have very useful functions, but these are global to your entire 
application. Think about how you might encapsulate the card building functionality into a single function.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Again, really cool that you were able to solve this problem using javascript alone (without user input). This
is an interesting approach, and I'm curious to see how what you learned will affect how you approach project 2. I know you expressed interest
in wanting to do more with CSS - maybe you can incorporate visuals into your MVP into the future. Also, several others have included
unsolved problems or things to do next in your readme. This would be helpful to future you should you decide to revisit the code.
